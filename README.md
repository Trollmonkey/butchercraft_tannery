# Butchercraft: Tannery

An addon mod for Butchercraft that adds functional hide tanning using a new Tanning Rack.

## What This Mod Adds

- A Tanning Rack block
- A multi-stage hide processing workflow:
    - Raw Hide → Scraped Hide → Leather
- Integration with Butchercraft entity drops

## Requirements

- Minecraft 1.21.1
- NeoForge
- Butchercraft

## How It Works

Replaces the leather dropped from Butchercraft meat hooks with Raw Hides.  These will need to 
be processed on the new Tanning Rack.  
- Make sure you place your rack in the sunlight, two blocks over a campfire.
- Right-click the Raw Hide onto the Tanning Rack and scrape it clean with a knife.  
- In 60 seconds (configurable), your hide will cure into ready to use leather.

## Compatibility

- Designed specifically for Butchercraft.
- Works with most knives using modern tagging standards.

## Notes

- Some loot table paths intentionally overwrite Butchercraft data for integration purposes.
